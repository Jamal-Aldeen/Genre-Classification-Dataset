# Movie Genre Classification

## Overview
This project classifies movie genres using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models.

## Files
- `train_data.txt`: Training data with movie titles, genres, and descriptions.
- `test_data.txt`: Test data with movie titles and descriptions.
- `test_data_solution.txt`: Test solution with actual genres.
- `movie_genre_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
- `predicted_genres.csv`: Test data with predicted genres.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, scikit-learn


## Analysis
- Explored and visualized genre distribution in training data.
- Cleaned and preprocessed text data.
- Used TF-IDF for text vectorization.
- Trained Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models.
- Evaluated models on a validation set.
- Made predictions on the test data.

## Results
- Predicted genres stored in `predicted_genres.csv`.
- Compared model performance based on accuracy and solution accuracy.
